# C3JS AngularJS directives

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/jettro/c3-angular-directive](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/jettro/c3-angular-directive?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This repository contains directives that let you easily create graphs using the c3js library. Most of the options that are available in c3js are now also available to you in angularjs. Below one of the most basic examples:
```html
<c3chart bindto-id="chart1">
	<chart-column column-id="data-1" 
				  column-values="30,200,100,400,150,250"
				  column-type="line"/>		
</c3chart>

```

# Documentation
There is a page with samples and documentation available:
http://jettro.github.io/c3-angular-directive/

There is now extensive API docs available here:
http://jettro.github.io/c3-angular-directive/api-docs/0.7/index.html

The project contains a number of examples that can be started using grunt:

```
grunt devserver
```

## Goal
Come up with a number of directives to integrate C3js with AngularJS

## Installation and development
We are using grunt and bower during development. Bower makes it easier to use it for your own project as well. More on this in the next section. If you want to try out the project and change sources or something like that, you can use bower and grunt to do development.

First use npm to install all grunt plugins, than use bower to install all bower dependencies.
```
npm install
bower install
```
Now grunt is available, you can use some of the utilities that grunt has in store for you. A nice one is to use the watch task and change one of the samples. There is also a plugin in place for running a development server. Just type _grunt devserver_ and connect to port 8888 on your localhost.


## Using it in your own project
The easiest way to use the directives is to use bower to install it to your project.
```
bower install c3-angular --save
```
In the end you just need one file in your project: c3-angular.min.js

## Version History

SOme final functionalities for the initial release. Want to add click events on the legend and maybe some other features.

### 0.7.0
Focus is improvements to the structure of the project and the documentation. Also fixed some bugs.

### 0.6.0
Main part to move to a higher version is that we have the possibility now to add a callback function. In the examples folder there is a page callback-sample.html that shows how to do this. You can register the callback function to recevei the actual chart object that you can manipulate using the c3js API methods.
